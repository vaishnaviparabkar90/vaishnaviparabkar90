👋 Hi, I’m @vaishnaviparabkar90
👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, collaborative tools, and open-source contributions.
🌱 I’m currently learning AI/ML, DSA, and contributing to open-source projects.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-time web applications, hackathon projects, and AI-driven solutions.
📫 How to reach me: [parabkarvaishnavi24@gmail.com]
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I’m supposed to be mastering circuits in Electronics, but here I am debugging code more than wiring circuits. Turns out React hooks and APIs are just as electrifying as resistors!
